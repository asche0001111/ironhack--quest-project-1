steps:

we imported a dataset called main data using  kaggle API

we started cleaning the data but the data was already cleaned

there are 3 hypothesis 

we examining our data through checking highest "bmi" and such

we started the group by analysis, checking the hishest charges per each of the differen attributes like region, age group, bmi group. we created bmi group and age group by using bins and dividing each of them into categories

importing a second dataset through webscraping containing 50 states and the PCPI for each of the states

we started grouping the states into 4 regions which were in the main data

we merged the 2 datasets

started some group by analysis again

wrote the findings

checked if the data is cleaned

imported a third dataset through web scraping that contains the average annual cancer incidents per state  and again mapped them into the 4 regions we initially had and the merge them with the merged dataset

then some data analysis
